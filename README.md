## 👀 Fun facts about me:
- Even though I can do both Frontend and Backend, I rather do Frontend since I enjoy more the visual side of a website than the functional side.
- I really enjoy doing UI / UX, it's probably my favorite part of making a website.
- I can either have too much energy to waste or too little energy to waste.
- I'm a really big Rhythm game and VR Enthusiast!

## 🤹 Other skills I have:
- I've been into Video Editing and Graphic Design for the past 5 years!
- I make music in my free time! (Nothing professional, just something I do for fun)

## 🏁 Goals:
- Improve in PHP and deepen my knowledge with Frameworks;
- Finish making my own website;
- *Maybe* sleep a bit more.
